Ultimately there will never be just one way to do front-end JavaScript because everyone brings their own opinions on solving computer science problems, heavily influenced by the language(s) they use on the back-end (or that they learned in school). Java, C#, and C++ developers will always fiend for some syntactic sugar that makes them feel like they're writing object oriented code in their "preferred" language. Ruby developers like their Emberjs and/or Coffeescript. PHP laravel developers tend to love Vue. Haskell devs love Purescript and Elm. And the list goes on and on.

If you're thinking back-end JavaScript is lacking this kind of churn you're mistaken (or just missed what's out there). Sails, Nest, Feathers, Nodal, Polka, Fastify, Hapi, Restify, and Express are all different, and mostly they are drastically different from each other.

It takes longer than a year to "learn JavaScript". Kyle Simpson brings this up in the intro to one of his books in the "You don't know JS" series that the fundamental flaw is that it's easy to get started with JavaScript and easy to hit a plateau with it and not realize how broad and deep journey into JavaScript mastery will take you.

The key point is not to over simplify or give up on learning the variety of dialects that are possible. JavaScript is still the most widely used programming language and when so many other brains are all doing a thing together you're inevitably going to see complexity, but you'll also find a ton of innovation and elegance.

If you choose to be a career JavaScript developer there's no escaping that, as you'll rarely get to decide how you get to code in JavaScript at a given employer. Becoming versatile and fluent in a variety of dialects is much wiser than searching for a sliver bullet.
